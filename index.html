				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p> Hi there! My name is Michal and currently I am participating in CodersTrust course. This is my second webpage and as this is beginning of my programming adventure I can say that I am definitely going till the end of this ride. As programming is often perceived as hard and overwhelming I must admit that with a little effort I can understand and use knowledge from this course in projects which we are doing.</p>
