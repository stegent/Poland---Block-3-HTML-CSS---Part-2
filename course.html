				<p> This is the name of the competition that I took part and I have become one of 40 finalists who have now enrolled for this course. We had couple of tasks to complete: we had to take a test which was checking our English level, we have recorded our first video about why we wanted to become freelancers and also we could create our first simple website. And after that there was the worst part – WAITIIIIIING! It was terrible, but as this was quite long ago, now I can say that it was worth it. </p>
